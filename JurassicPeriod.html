<!--Info-->
<p> The Allosaurus is one of the most famous dinosaurs to ever live. Like the earlier herrerasaurus it is a therapod. 
    It lived in the late jurassic period as an apex predator that preyed on medium to large herboviores, Name of Dinoly sauropods that could grow twice it's size.
    Allosauruses might of hunted in small packs and displayed social behaviour, but this is debated by many scientist.
    Rivalling the largest predator of its time, growing up to 9m and weighing 2.7 tonnes. One of the first to grow so large, but definitly not the last.

<!--Info-->
<p> Mamenchisaurus is a gargantuan late jurassic and early Cretaceous sauropod, one of the biggest to ever live.
    It weighed 27,000kg, but half of this was just its neck.
    The Mamenchisaurus grows 11m tall using its long neck to eat plants of all sizes without having to walk around.
    Most Mamenchisaurs liked to live in smaller groups mainly by themselves.

    <h2> Chungkingosaurus </h2>

<div class="EverythingChunkingosaurus">

    <img class="ChungkingosaurusImage" src="Chungkingosaurus.png" alt="ChungkingosaurusImage">
  <!--Info-->
<p> Chunkingosaurus was a stegosaur the lived in china during the late triassic.
    It was 5m long and weighed up to 3,000kg. Like the similar stegosaurus, 
    chunkingosaurus had a very small head and plate like spins along its 
    back that begin to look a lot like spikes the closer you get to the end of the tail.
    It would use it's tail as a defense mechanism warding of predators with strong swings.

    <h2> Ichthyosaurus (not a dinosaur) </h2>
          <!-- Div controlling the image and info-->
<div class="EverythingIcthyosaurus">
               <!--Image-->
    <img class="IchthyosaurusImage" src="Ichthyosaurus.png" alt="IchthyosaurusImage">
  <!--Info-->
<p> Icthyosaur is another non-dinosaur. It's Name of Dino is greek and means 'fish lizard' as it was a ocean duelling reptile of the early triassic. 
    Icthyosaurs size could range massively, some were as big as salmon and some could get up to 20m! 
    That's comparable to the size of a blue whale! Icthyosaurs are known to be some of the only reptiles to birth live young.
    One of the most famous icthyosaur fossils ever found was one with a baby in its stomach, scientist were unable to tell if 
    the baby was eaten or just hadn't been born yet.
(note: The image used is not that of an icthyosaurus but an opthalmosaurus, which is a member of the icthyosauridae.)
