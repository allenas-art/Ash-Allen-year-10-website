<!-- A introduction paragraph with general information about Dinosaurs.-->
<p class="IntroPara"> In just 17 minutes you'll be able to get clued up on the basics of the creatures that dominated the planet for more than 170 million years (Maybe even become a pretend dinosaur expert).
</p>
<p class="IntroPara">  So first of all, we know dinosaurs ruled the Earth for approximately 170 million years. 
    This Era is called the Mesozoic, and is split into three distinct periods. 
    First came the triassic, when dinosaurs were first emerging from the cracks and crevices of our planet.
    Then the jurassic, were dinosaurs evloved further and became magnificently complex creatures.
    And finally came the cretaceous. The final period of dinosaurs, when t-rex's and triceratops would duel, and massive sauropods would wander the plains.
   On this journey we will explore the three periods and some of the dinosaurs that rampaged our world during their time, and some monsters that weren't dinosaurs at all.</p>
