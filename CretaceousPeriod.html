  They are the definition of an apex predator, with one of the strongest bite forces of all time, massive and powerful legs, as well as a massive 14m long, 4m tall 8 tonne body.
    T-Rexes lived in North America during the late cretaceous, all the way up to the great extinction.

    Fun fact, Tyrannosaurus Rex means "tyrant lizard king".
