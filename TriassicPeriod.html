    <!--Information and images on three Dinosaurs from the Triassic period + one non-Dinosaur.-->

    <!--Name of Dino-->
    <h2> Herrerasaurus </h2>

<!--Info-->
<p> The herrerasaurus was an early version of the T-rex, as it is one of the first of the theropod group, which the T-rex is also a part of.
    Although it was the T-rex's ancestor, the herrerasaurus grew to not nearly half the size.
    It was about the height of a human and 6 meters long. 
    Like other therapods, it was bipedal predator, meaning it hunted other dinos with two legs and two arms.
    It lived during the late triassic period in parts of South America, mainly Argentina.

 <h2> Plateosaurus </h2>
<!-- Div controlling the image and info-->
<div class="EverythingPlateosaurus">
      <!--Image-->
<img class="PlateosaurusImage" src="Plateosaurus.png" alt="PlateosaurusImage">
<!--Info-->
<p> Like the herrerasaurus, and many other triassic dinosaurs, the plateosaurus was a sancestor of many dinosaurs to come.
    It was a sauropod meaning it was a member of the same family as the famous diplodocus and brachiosaurus.
    It's diet consisted of rough foliage like ferns and cornifers around its habitat in Central and Northern Europe.
    Fully grown Adults weighed up to 4,000kg and were 10 meters long, which seems huge but pales in comparison to its later decendents.

<h2> Ceolophysis </h2>
<!-- Div controlling the image and info-->
<div class="EverythingCoelophysis">
     <!--Image-->
<img class="CoelophysisImage" src="Ceolophysis.png" alt="CoelophysisImage">
<!--Info-->
<p> Ceolophysis was also a Late Triasic Dinosaur, but it lived in North America.
    It was a smaller predator that only grew to 3 meters long, becoming known for its light frame and agility.
    It was bipedal and quite social, hunting fish and other small reptiles in groups like wolves. 
    Some research has shown that this Dinosaur showed many traits similar to our modern birds.

<!--Info-->
<p> Peteinosaurus was not actualy a dinosaur but a pterosaur (pronounced teh-ruh-sor) which is a group of 
    animals known to be the first sour for the skys (not counting bugs and stuff like that). The peteinosaurus was a small sized member of the pterosaurs 
    with a wing span of only 60cm. It lived in the late triassic period in around Italy.
